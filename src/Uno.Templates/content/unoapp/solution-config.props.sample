        This file is used to control the platforms compiled by Visual Studio, and allow for a faster
        build when testing for a single platform. This will also result in better intellisense, as
        the compiler will only load the assemblies for the platforms that are being built. You do not
        need to use this when compiling from Visual Studio Code, the command line or other IDEs.

        Instructions:
        1) Copy this file and remove the ".sample" name
        2) Uncomment the single property below for the target you want to build
        3) Make sure to do a Rebuild, so that nuget restores the proper packages for the new target

        Notes:
        - You may optionally close the solution before making changes and reload the solution afterwards. This will avoid Visual Studio
          asking you to reload any projects, it will also ensure that the changes are picked up by Visual Studio, and trigger a restore of
          the packages.
        - You may want to unload the platform heads that you are not going to build for. This will ensure that Visual Studio does not
          try to build them, and will speed up the build process.
